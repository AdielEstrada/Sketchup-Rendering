# Sketchup-Rendering
After doing a Master Plan of a recreational center, we created our vision for the recreational center on sketchup. This allowed us to practice 3D modeling software and gain experience with this kind of software. One valuable lesson I learned is that Sketchup is mainly used for quick concept-generation. 

The following images show the Recreational Center in it's different views. For this project, we were only focusing on the exterior. In the following images, one is the sketchup concept, which shows how it should look, and the following shows the Ai Remdered iamge. Note that it's not exact.
